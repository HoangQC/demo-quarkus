# demo-quarkus

## Sample code for Red Hat OpenShift, to be used as an "s2i" example

Build an application using OpenShift's built-in source-to-image (s2i) technology. This technology pulls source code from a git repository and builds an application.

This demo-quarkus repo, written in Java (using the Quarkus framework), supports that example (i.e. s2i) for developers that are interested in the Java programming language.
